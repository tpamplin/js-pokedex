This is a simple pokedex application written primarily in Javascript.
It calls the pokeapi to get a list of pokemon, and then you can click on one of the buttons on screen to see how tall that pokemon is, and what it looks like.

Dependencies:
jquery version 3.7.1
bootstrap version 5.3.3
Popperjs version 2.11.8

simply run the index.html file with the current filesystem in tact on the internet-connected web browser of your choice to see a list of buttons with pokemon names, which you can click for more details.
